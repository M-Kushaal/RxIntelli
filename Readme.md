## **🌍 The Problem**

* Medical prescriptions are handwritten, messy, and hard to read.

* Tracking medicines, dosage, and history is confusing.

* Doctors and patients both waste time finding past prescriptions.  
* Semantic Search over prescription becomes almost impossible.

**Step 1: Upload Prescription**  
 📸 Snap or upload an image of your prescription.

**Step 2: AI Reads It**  
 🧠 LoopCare’s **PaliGemma Vision-Language Model** transcribes the text and expands abbreviations like:

* “BID → twice a day”

* “PO → by mouth”

**Step 3: Auto Logging**  
 💾 The transcribed text is stored as **semantic vectors (MiniLM \+ FAISS)** for instant retrieval.

**Step 4: Ask Anything**  
 💬 Powered by **Groq \+ Llama 3.3 70B**, you can query naturally:

“Show me my last antibiotic prescription”  
 “What did my doctor prescribe for fever?”
